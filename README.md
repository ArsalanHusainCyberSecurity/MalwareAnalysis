<h1> WannaCry Malware Analysis </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I analyzed the WannaCry Ransomware file on a Linux virtual machine, uncovering Windows API calls and revealing its highly dangerous nature through dynamic code analysis.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Parrot</b> 
- <b>Powershell</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>Linux (HTB VM)</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<br />
<br />
In VM linux terminal locate WannaCry File:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Run the file command to see file type: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Ran String commnd to see suspicious code. Found Windows API Calls :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We want to save the string to a file for further analysis:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next we will check the file's reputation by getting its file hash:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will plug this file has into virustotal to see the reputation. Virustotal recognizes it as a very dangerous malware:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Dynamic Code analysis results: As you can see the virus is extremely dangerous since it not only deletes all your backups but it also holds all your PC information hostage via ransomware  <br/>
